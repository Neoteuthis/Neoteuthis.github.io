Most of you will have magical abilities at your disposal to aid your quests. Where will the adventure take you? Far beyond your home province, out of your own continent, and even to other worlds.

In this game, you will Follow clues and go on quests to uncover the secrets of the universe, one lost teddy or errant demon lord at a time. This site will guide you through everything you need to know to get started!
